This directory contains Python code for DELPH-IN.

Subdirectories are organized by library category (e.g. tdl, mrs, etc)
or by task (evaluation, etc).

Code is under a delphin subdirectory because of how the Python package
management system works (hyphens are not allowed in module names, for
example). Only documentation and high-level scripts should go in this
top directory.
